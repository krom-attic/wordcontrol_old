===========

Word Control is an application for a collaboration on documenting endangered languages, especially its lexicon and phonology.

Development process
-------------------
Any work to be done must be planned against some milestone. This planning is made by @kromkrom.

Work items are:
* Enhancements
* Bugs

Work items are created based on:
* Use cases (UC)
* Functions (F)
* Change requests (CRs)

Any new CR's effect is evaluated, then:
* If it affects business logic, it cause an enhancement and is attached to a new or to an existing UC
* If it affects solution, it cause an enhancement and is attached to a new or to an existing F
* If it affects code, but none of the above, it is a bug

A CR should be converted to a work item directly if there is no one-to-many (or more complex) relation between the CR and the work items.

After work planned for an UC or F is done, the results are recorded in the corresponding UC or F.
Any pending changes caused by CRs to UCs and Fs are made only after the current realisation state is documented.
