WordControl
===========

Word Control is an application for a collaboration on documenting endangered languages, especially its lexicon and phonology.
Some earlier documentation is in Russian. But as this project is intended for international use, all newer documentation is in English.  

Basic information
-----------------
WordControl is a Django app. Current Django branch is 1.8.x.  
Test server: http://kotimaa.ru/wordcontrol/

Development process (v. 3)
--------------------------
Any work to be done must be planned against some milestone. This planning is made by @kromkrom.

Work items are tasks:
* Enhancements
* Bugs
* Other tasks

Work items are created based on change requests (CRs) and are attached to a new or to an existing UC or other model/requirement.
A CR should be converted to a work item directly if there is no one-to-many (or more complex) relation between the CR and the work items.

Any new CR's effect is evaluated, then:
* If CR alters documented solution, it causes a new enhancement
* Otherwise it may be a bug

After work item is done, solution is documented to corresponding UC or other model/requirement.
Hence documentation reflect current release.
Models and requirement are kept in wiki.
